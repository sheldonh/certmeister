Feature: Signature algorithm policy

	As the operator of a conditionally autosigning certification authority
	When deciding whether to sign a certificate
	I want to reject certificate signing requests with weak signature algorithms
	In order to enforce the use of strong cryptography across our network.

Desired rspec output:

	Certmeister::Policy::SignatureAlgorithm
	  may be configured with a set of strong signature algorithms
	  defaults to ["sha256"] as the set of strong signature algorithms
	  demands a request
	  refuses to authenticate a request with a missing pem
	  refuses to authenticate an invalid pem
	  refuses to authenticate a request with a weak signature algorithm
	  authenticates a request with a strong signature algorithm

Use spec/certmeister/policy/key_bits_spec.rb as a guide to specifying the behaviour.

Use lib/certmeister/policy/key_bits.rb as a guide to implementing the behaviour.

You may find these fixtures useful:

	fixtures/sha1_4096bit.csr
	fixtures/sha256_4096bit.csr

The signature algorithm of a CSR is provided by the OpenSSL::X509::Request#signature_algorithm method.
